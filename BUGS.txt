Things that are broken:
  * It is possible to edit an MD and change their type to non-MD
    status without reassigning the studies they supervise.
  * Patient pages display "Patient name" instead of actual name
  * Entering data longer than the allowed limit for VARCHAR types
    crashes the query.
  * Weird dates produce weird results (Feb 31 20000 = Dec 31 1969
  * Emails without an @ or . are accepted.
  * Editing results with nonexistent patient names crashes the
    system.
  * Create result needs error messages.
  * Edit pages don't remember changes past page reloads (like
    adding types).
  * SQL injections work on edit results page.
  * Integers can go over INT_MAX and cause problems.
  * Excluding numtypes from a manually-entered URL for pages with
    type addition boxes breaks the system
  * Creating results for a study the user doesn't have read/write
    access to is possible.  So is editing and deleting these results.
  * It is possible to add blank medical conditions and medications to
    patients.
