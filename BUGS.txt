Things that are broken:
  * [SK] It is possible to edit an MD and change their type to non-MD
    status without reassigning the studies they supervise.
  * no success message on these pages:
    * Edit result
    * Add result
    * Delete result
    * 
  * [SK] Entering data longer than the allowed limit for VARCHAR types
    crashes the query.
  * Invalid supervisor names break the query.
  * [SK] Invalid phone numbers are accepted.
  * [SK] Weird dates produce weird results (Feb 31 20000 = Dec 31 1969
  * [SK] Emails without an @ or . are accepted.
  * [SK] Editing results with nonexistent patient names crashes the
    system.
  * [SK] Create result needs error messages.
  * [SK] Edit result needs error messages.
  * [SK] Edit pages don't remember changes past page reloads (like
    adding types).
  * [SK] SQL injections work on edit results page.
  * [SK] Integers can go over INT_MAX and cause problems.
  * [SK] Excluding numtypes from a manually-entered URL for pages with
    type addition boxes breaks the system
  * [SK] Creating results for a study the user doesn't have read/write
    access to is possible.  So is editing and deleting these results.
